This documentation covers the **Discovery Server testing framework**, the tool suite used to validate the
Discovery Server discovery mechanism of |fastdds|_.

.. important::

    Discovery Server is a discovery mechanism built into |fastdds|_, not a separate product.
    The description, configuration and usage of the discovery mechanism itself are documented in the
    `Fast DDS documentation <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/discovery/discovery.html>`_.
    This documentation only explains how to build, configure and run the framework that tests it.

The framework is made of two parts:

*   The ``discovery-server`` tool, an executable that reads a single XML configuration file and deploys the DDS
    entities described in it (servers, clients, publishers and subscribers), creating and destroying them at the
    stated times.
    The tool listens to the discovery information received by every participant it creates, stores it in a database,
    and dumps *snapshots* of that database, that is, the collective knowledge of every deployed participant at a
    given instant.

*   A Python test suite that runs the tool over each test case and validates the resulting snapshots against the
    expected discovery state. The suite is registered with CTest and is the one executed by the framework's CI.

The framework's source code is available in the
`Discovery Server GitHub repository <https://github.com/eProsima/Discovery-Server-Testing-Framework>`__.
